    {\LARGE \bf  - Serializable Consistency over Eventual Consistency without Transactions\\} 
}


\section{Introduction}
In this paper we present the outline of a system which provides general ACID semantics
with only minor extensions to an ordered eventually consistency system.

\section{General System Semantics}

\begin{itemize}
   \item multi-valued
   \item progressive
   \item referentially transparent
\end{itemize}

\section{Serializable Consistency}

\section{Concurrency and Efficacy}
It should be intuitive that the construction above generates 


\section{Atomicity and Fault Tolerance}

\section{Conclusion}
We've presented a system which strongly resembles a classic ACID database
without relying on the transaction abstraction.
